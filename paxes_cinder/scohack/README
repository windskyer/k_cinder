paxes_cinder.scohack
----------------

Several modules in this package were adapted from glance.store modules

Strategically, image import (probably) belongs in glance not in cinder

However, tactically, for PowerVC R2FP1, image import lives here in
paxes_cinder.scohack.

Modules borrowed from glance, while modified, have been left close to
their original form to support the possibility that the image import
function will be moved to glance in future releases
